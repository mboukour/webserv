- Add methods / autoindex to the ServerFactory
- Parse Location subBlocks


I might implement this if i have time

1. location xd
Behavior: This is a prefix-based location that matches any URI starting with xd.

Examples:

/xd → Matches.

/xdfile → Matches.

/path/xd → Does not match (because xd is not at the start of the URI).

Use Case: Rarely used, as it can lead to unexpected matches (e.g., /xdfile).

2. location /xd
Behavior: This is a prefix-based location that matches any URI starting with /xd.

Examples:

/xd → Matches.

/xd/file → Matches.

/xdfile → Does not match (because /xd is not a complete prefix).

Use Case: Commonly used to match specific subpaths (e.g., /xd, /xd/...).
